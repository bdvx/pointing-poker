        Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified
        technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile
        principles. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by
        playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them
        aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By
        hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias
        of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for
        subsequent estimates.
